### Hi there 👋 - I'm Stefan. 
----
1. 👨🏾‍🎓 Currently, I'm learning the fundamentals of:
    - Bash commands and scripting
    - Python
    - Terraform 
    - Networking
    - Git
    - Cloud Security
    - DevOps
2. 👨🏾‍🎓 Following that, I'll be **refreshing** my *AWS Cloud Practitioner and Solutions Architect - Associate* knowledge.

3. 🤔 I’ll need help with understanding how all invested parties come together and ***create a cloud solution.***
4. 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will help me validate my skills as I journey towards becoming a cloud professional.
5. 💬 Ask me about what kind of cloud professional do **"I"** want to be?
