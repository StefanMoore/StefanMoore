## About Me

Iâ€™m a midlife career changer working to start a new career as a cloud professional.

## Learning Journey

Currently, I'm validating my cloud skillset through various learning and hands-on experiences.
## Aspirations

Instead of being a spectator, I want to be a valuable contributor to my future employer by taking advantage of opportunities that are present by being a cloud professional. To apply and grow this knowledge of modern technology to influence and innovate business and technology capabilities that pave the way for best-in-class solutions.
## Let's Connect
I'm looking to connect with cloud professionals, mentors, and potential collaborators to get my start and grow my career in the cloud.
