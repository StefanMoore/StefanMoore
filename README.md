### About Me
----
Being certified as an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and AWS Solutions Architect – Associate, I’m (re)learning the AWS cloud infrastructure, developing skills across multiple technologies and platforms, while building skills required of a modern business professional.

I’ll be working on cloud-based projects designed to bridge the gap from theoretical knowledge (*certifications*) to practical knowledge (*real world*).

Business Pro descript here.


### Learning Journey
----
My learning journey will consist of:
1. The AWS Platform and not limited to the following things I should know within the platform
    1. 🔒 Security
    1. 💻 Compute
    1. 💾 Storage
    1. 🗂 Database
    1. 🌐 Networking

## Aspirations
----
Instead of being a spectator, I want to be a valuable contributor to my future employer by taking advantage of opportunities that are present by being a cloud professional. To apply and grow this knowledge of modern technology to influence and innovate business and technology capabilities that pave the way for best-in-class solutions.

## Let's Connect
----
I'm looking to connect with cloud professionals, mentors, and potential collaborators to get my start and grow my career in the cloud.
