> [!NOTE]
> I am not a programmer. Nor, I do not have an understanding of most of the code within this repository. The goal for me is to be confident using the technologies that I am learning (Docker, Terraform, Python, Linux/Bash, Git). This repository will contain the exercises from Udemy to reinforce the concepts that I have learned.
