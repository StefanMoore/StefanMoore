<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Stefan</h1>
<h3 align="center">Aspiring AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner actively beginning a career in AWS Cloud technologies.</h3>

🔭 I’m currently working on developing AWS skills, building a portfolio, and working towards AWS certifications.

🌱 I’m currently learning best practices for deploying and managing cloud applications.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on beginner & intermediate projects that will help me understand how the wide range of AWS services fit together.

🤝 I’m looking for help with writing a README to showcase my skills and blog post about each project.

💬 Ask me about what I’ve learned, the challenges I faced, and how I solved them and any enhancements I plan to make in the future.
